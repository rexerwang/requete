# http-request

`http-request` is a lightweight client-side (browsers) request library based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
It provides an API similar to [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). And supports middleware for processing requests and responses.

In addition, `http-request` also includes an [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) adapter, which allows it to be used in older browsers that do not support Fetch, and provides polyfills to simplify import.
